When I played Minecraft, my favourite pastime was watching YouTubers make circuits in the game. At the time, the creators were developing faster and faster line drawing machines. I remember that Newomaster managed to create a solid-state one that could draw each pixel in 8 ticks (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKIO9ReNNcg). I've always wanted to make my own but I couldn't understand the algebra at the time. So I guess this is my way of accomplishing a lifelong dream.
